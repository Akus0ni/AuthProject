== Gathering Results

Evaluation will focus on verifying that the core functional and non-functional requirements are met. This will include:

1. **Functional Validation**
  - Verify that local login/signup works correctly and securely.
  - Test login with Google and GitHub for both new and existing users.
  - Confirm that `Admin` users can perform all user CRUD operations via the UI.
  - Confirm that `User` role has read-only access and is correctly restricted from create/update/delete operations.
  - Ensure refresh token flow works as intended and access tokens are refreshed without forcing logout.

2. **Security Checks**
  - Validate password hashes are stored using bcrypt.
  - Ensure JWTs include expiration and role claims.
  - Manually and automatically test role-based endpoint access.
  - Review OAuth implementation against provider docs for token validation and user identity.

3. **Scalability Testing**
  - Load test login and token generation endpoints under simulated user traffic.
  - Test database performance with a few thousand user records.

4. **Code & Infrastructure Review**
  - Ensure code adheres to SOLID and clean architecture principles.
  - Confirm all secrets are managed via environment configs.
  - Validate that the system can be extended with more SSO providers with minimal effort.

5. **Success Criteria**
  - All Must/Should requirements fulfilled with passed QA.
  - No major security vulnerabilities detected in authentication/authorization flows.
  - Deployed system stable under moderate concurrent load (e.g., 100â€“500 concurrent users).
